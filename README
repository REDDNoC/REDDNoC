# Hi, I’m @REDDNoC

## Profile
Founder and technical lead behind **Cryptobeam** and the **DAMA** ecosystem. My work centers on building regulated-market infrastructure for digital assets—exchange-grade trading systems, institutional payments, and cross-border settlement workflows—with a focus on controls, auditability, and operational resilience.

## Current work
- **Institutional exchange architecture**: performance-oriented backend services, market connectivity, and production-grade operational tooling for a multi-venue digital asset marketplace.
- **DAMA Protocol**: an **ISO 20022–aligned** digital asset protocol designed for interoperability, compliance-by-design, and post-quantum forward security.
- **Settlement and tokenized market infrastructure**: cross-chain messaging and asset portability, with an emphasis on risk management, transparency, and verifiable recordkeeping.

## Technical focus areas
- Low-latency backend systems and event-driven architectures for trading and settlement
- Market connectivity and integration: **FIX**, REST, WebSocket; venue connectivity patterns and reliability engineering
- Compliance-grade ledgering and observability: audit trails, policy enforcement, and reporting primitives
- Partner integrations: **Plaid**, sponsor banking (e.g., **Customers Bank**), **Fireblocks**, **Chainalysis**, **Auth0**
